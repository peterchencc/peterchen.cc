title: About Me
---

Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Peter Chen from Taiwan. üëã

I'm a **Software Engineer** working at **Singapore** previously. Focusing on the web platform, more on **front-end** side.

I'm easy-going, a team player and have a good product sense. Always passionate to improve user experience and contribute to products from an engineering perspective.

This is my website where I write about software engineering and other stuff that I am interested in.

I currently live in **Taipei, Taiwan**. And about to move to **Berlin, Germany**!

### First Job & Turning Point

After my computer science degree and finished my one-year military duty, I've been using PHP on my first job in a corporate company. It‚Äôs a digital media publisher that focused on technology news, product reviews, interior design, and traveling.

While working on real programming stuff, I found out that web development is really what I want. And how we can building on the internet is really cool! I want to build and involve amazing products that peoples use.

One day I heard Startup this word. What is startup? How startups build their product? How to bootstrap fast and start connecting to users? And I want to learn new stuff that can build things fast and efficient.

So I attended a 10 weeks coding bootcamp call **Alpha Camp** which taught us full-stack web development course. The bootcamp re-boot my software development skills and connect with people in the startup industry. Most importantly, I got an internship opportunity to Singapore after finished the course.

I took 3-month as a web development intern in a Singapore-based development studio. I developed a web platform using Ruby on Rails, and worked with an international team by agile development. It‚Äôs very meaningful to me that I had this opportunity to go global and saw differently.

### Full-Stack in Startup

After a short-term intern in Singapore. A bootcamp's alumnus invite me to join his startup. **Meet.jobs** help talented people to find jobs in the global market.

I was the only Full-Stack engineer back then. Built the job site from scratch, and developed all key features for internationalization site by **Ruby on Rails**.

I also took on product management responsibility, closely working with founders to accommodate revenue model evolvement, draw prototypes, prioritize tasks and features, server maintenance, mentor others engineers and running our scrum.

### Relocate to Singapore

Because I want to go global and explore more. Two years later, I got a job offer from Singapore.

A leading food reviews platform in Singapore that helps people find the perfect places to eat. **Burpple** has a complete agile team with web and apps products. And we launched a subscription program including payment.

I gradually take on more front-end tasks because I am passionate to improve user experience. I did something like revamping the website's UI, integrating **Vue.js**, optimizing website performance, etc.

### Conference, Meet-up & Help Others Learn

I like to communicate with people. Because my previous companies are small. One of the ways to improve my development skill is to find others learning resources from communities. I've attended some conferences like Ruby Conf Taiwan, COSCUP TW, Red Dot Ruby Conf Singapore, SXSW, etc. Joined meet-ups like Singapore CSS, Singapore JS, Singapore Ruby Group.

Because attending bootcamp changed me a lot. So I give back to bootcamp community. Being a teaching assistant for a web development bootcamp in Singapore, held daily office hours to provide support to students' learning process. And joining study group with coding bootcamp alumni.
